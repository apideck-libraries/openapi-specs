    Welcome to the Lead API.


    You can use the API to access all lead endpoints, such as the Add Lead endpoint to create leads, or the Leads endpoint to get all leads for a specific consumer.


    ## Base URL


    The base URL for all API requests is ```https://unify.apideck.com/lead```


    ## Headers

    Custom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) states header names are case insensitive.

    latest supported API version*


    ## GraphQL


    Use the [GraphQL playground](https://unify.apideck.com/graphql) to test out the GraphQL API. 


    ## SDKs and API Clients


    Upcoming. [Request the SDK of your choice](https://integrations.apideck.com/request).


    ## Debugging


    Because of the nature of the abstraction we do in Apideck Unify we still provide the option to the receive raw requests and responses being handled underlying. By including the raw flag `?raw=true` in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the reponse size and can introduce extra latency.


    ## Errors


    The API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customised error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.


    | Code               	| Title          	| Description                                                                                                                                                            	|

    | 201                	| Created        	| Resource successfully created.                                                                                                                                         	|

    | 204                	| No Content     	| Request successful with no content returned.                                                                                                                           	|

    | 400                	| Bad Request    	| Request was unacceptable. Double check the documentation to make sure you provided the correct parameters. In most cases the response will contain more info to debug. 	|

    | 401                	| Unauthorised   	| The provided API key is invalid.                                                                                                                                       	|

    | 402                	| Request Failed 	| Valid parameters but the request failed.                                                                                                                               	|

    | 409                	| Duplicate      	| Resource already exists.                                                                                                                                               	|

    | 500, 502, 503, 504 	| Server Errors  	| Something went wrong with the Unify API. These errors are logged on our side. You can contact our team to resolve the issue.                                           	|


    ### Handling errors


    The Unify API and SDKs can produce errors for many reasons, such as a failed requests due to unconfigured integrations, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability.


    ## Postman


    If you are working with APIs, you are probably already familiar with Postman, a development tool that enables you to configure and run API requests.


    We have preconfigured Postman collection that you can download. You will have to configure some environment variables to customize the requests. For more information on this, refer to Using this API with our Postman Collections.


    ## API Design


    ### API Styles and data formats


    #### REST API


    The API is organised around [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.


    ##### Available HTTP methods


    The Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter _method.


    ```

    POST /messages

    GET /messages

    GET /messages/{messageId}

    PATCH /messages/{messageId}

    DELETE /messages/{messageId}

    ```


    Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.


    ### Schema


    All API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.


    ### Meta


    Meta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.


    ### Idempotence (upcoming)


    To prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the  X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.


    Uniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)


    ### Request IDs


    Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.


    ### Fixed field types


    #### Dates


    The dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).


    This example ```2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z``` is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced "Zulu" per military/aviation tradition.


    The ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.


    #### Prices and Currencies


    All prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).


    For zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.


    All currency codes conform to [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

        To use API you have to sign up and get your own API key. Unify API
        accounts have sandbox mode and live mode API keys. 

        To change modes just use the appropriate key to get a live or test object. You can find your API keys on the unify settings of your Apideck app.

        Your Apideck application_id can also be found on the same page.


        Authenticate your API requests by including your test or live secret API key in the request header. 


        Bearer authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <your-apideck-api-key>`


        You should use the public keys on the SDKs and the secret keys to authenticate API requests.


        **Do not share or include your secret API keys on client side code. Your API keys carry significant privileges. Please ensure to keep them 100% secure and be sure to not share your secret API keys in areas that are publicly accessible like GitHub. See API Access Key Security for more information.


        Learn how to set the Authorization header inside Postman https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/authorization/#api-key


        Go to Unify to grab your API KEY https://app.apideck.com/unify/api-keys
